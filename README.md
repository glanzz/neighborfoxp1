### Neighbour FoxP1 

#### Author: Bhargav C N, Hitesh K

- The tool models the given variant provided as input in HGVS format by reading the fasta of the existing FOXP1 and mutating upon it.
- The mutation sequence model is used further compare with the genes that have affiliation towards FOXP1
- Various quanitifiable attributes are derived between these models
- The derived attributes are presented to visualize alongside the limited dataset of severity associated with the FOXP1 variant and possible precautions to be taken. This approach allows us to map the limited dataset (which as a whole provides for lesser correlation) to abundant data of genes which are different and provide high correlation to understand the role it plays in treatement of rare disease.
